#Inline Egg Timer 0.3Beta - Chrome Extension

I love cooking. When I hit the kitchen you can expect some frenetic activity to take place; which is why I'm always running out of timers. As the various delicacies cooking, baking or cooling down start stacking up my microwave and oven timers just don't cut it -- which is why I wrote this little chrome extension.

The *Inline Egg Timer* simply looks for time instances on the page and appends a clean, non-intrusive countdown timer on the same line.

*Caveat - this extension is under development and has a number of incomplete features.*

## Currently Works In

For simplicity's sake the timer currently works on a limited number of websites. Adding additional sites is as easy as editing manifest.json file.

* allrecipes.com
* epicurious.com
* marthastewart.com
* food.com

## TODO

* Stop finish *beep* on stop button click.
* Reset timer on reset button click.
* Add additional timers in DOM elements that contain more than 1 time instance.
* Refactor to capture more complex time units, ex. 1h 45min.
